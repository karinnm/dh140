No, for then we should be colliers.\\n\\nSamp. I mean, an we be in choler, we\\'ll draw.\\n\\nGreg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.\\n\\nSamp. I strike quickly, being moved.\\n\\nGreg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.\\n\\nSamp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.\\n\\n  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.\\n    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn\\'st away.\\n  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take\\n    the wall of any man or maid of Montague\\'s.\\n  Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the\\n    wall.\\n  Samp. \\'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,\\n    are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague\\'s men\\n    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.\\nGreg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\\n\\nSamp. \\'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off their heads.\\n\\nGreg. The heads of the maids?\\n\\n  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.\\n    Take it in what sense thou wilt.\\nGreg. They must take it in sense that feel it.\\n\\n  Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and \\'tis known I\\n    am a pretty piece of flesh.\\n  Greg. \\'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst\\n    been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of\\n    Montagues.\\nEnter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].\\n\\nSamp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.\\n\\nGreg. How? turn thy back and run?\\n\\nSamp. Fear me not.\\n\\nGreg. No, marry. I fear thee!\\n\\nSamp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\\n\\nGreg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.\\n\\nSamp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is disgrace to them, if they bear it.\\n\\nAbr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\n\\nSamp. I do bite my thumb, sir.\\n\\nAbr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\n\\nSamp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?\\n\\nGreg. [aside to Sampson] No.\\n\\nSamp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.\\n\\nGreg. Do you quarrel, sir?\\n\\nAbr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.\\n\\nSamp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as you.\\n\\nAbr. No better.\\n\\nSamp. Well, sir.\\n\\nEnter Benvolio.\\n\\nGreg.

They fight.\\n     Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or\\n                          partisans.\\nOfficer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!\\n\\nCitizens.

Why call you for a sword?\\n\\n  Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come\\n    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.\\nEnter Old Montague and his Wife.\\n\\nMon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.\\n\\nM. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\\n\\nEnter Prince Escalus, with his Train.\\n\\n  Prince.

Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\\n    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?\\n  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary\\n    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\\n    I drew to part them. In the instant came\\n    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar\\'d;\\n    Which, as he breath\\'d defiance to my ears,\\n    He swung about his head and cut the winds,\\n    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss\\'d him in scorn.\\n    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,\\n    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,\\n    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.\\n  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?\\n    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.\\n  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp\\'d sun\\n    Peer\\'d forth the golden window of the East,\\n    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;\\n    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore\\n    That westward rooteth from the city\\'s side,\\n    So early walking did I see your son.\\n    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me\\n    And stole into the covert of the wood.\\n    I- measuring his affections by my own,\\n    Which then most sought where most might not be found,\\n    Being one too many by my weary self-\\n    Pursu\\'d my humour, not Pursuing his,\\n    And gladly shunn\\'d who gladly fled from me.\\n  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,\\n    With tears augmenting the fresh morning\\'s dew,\\n    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\\n    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun\\n    Should in the furthest East bean to draw\\n    The shady curtains from Aurora\\'s bed,\\n    Away from light steals home my heavy son\\n    And private in his chamber pens himself,\\n    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight\\n    And makes himself an artificial night.\\n    Black and portentous must this humour prove\\n    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.\\nBen. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?\\n\\nMon. I neither know it nor can learn of him\\n\\nBen. Have you importun\\'d him by any means?\\n\\n  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;\\n    But he, his own affections\\' counsellor,\\n    Is to himself- I will not say how true-\\n    But to himself so secret and so close,\\n    So far from sounding and discovery,\\n    As is the bud bit with an envious worm\\n    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air\\n    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.\\n    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\\n    We would as willingly give cure as know.\\nEnter Romeo.\\n\\n  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,\\n    I\\'ll know his grievance, or be much denied.\\n  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay\\n    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let\\'s away,\\n                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].\\nBen. Good morrow, cousin.\\n\\nRom. Is the day so young?\\n\\nBen. But new struck nine.\\n\\n  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.\\n    Was that my father that went hence so fast?\\nBen. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo\\'s hours?\\n\\nRom. Not having that which having makes them short.\\n\\nBen. In love?\\n\\nRom. Out-\\n\\nBen. Of love?\\n\\nRom. Out of her favour where I am in love.\\n\\n  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,\\n    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\\n  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,\\n    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!\\n    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\\n    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\\n    Here\\'s much to do with hate, but more with love.\\n    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\\n    O anything, of nothing first create!\\n    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!\\n    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\\n    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\\n    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is\\n    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.\\n    Dost thou not laugh?\\nBen. No, coz, I rather weep.\\n\\nRom. Good heart, at what?\\n\\nBen. At thy good heart\\'s oppression.\\n\\n  Rom. Why, such is love\\'s transgression.\\n    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\\n    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest\\n    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\\n    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.\\n    Love is a smoke rais\\'d with the fume of sighs;\\n    Being purg\\'d, a fire sparkling in lovers\\' eyes;\\n    Being vex\\'d, a sea nourish\\'d with lovers\\' tears.\\n    What is it else? A madness most discreet,\\n    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\\n    Farewell, my coz.\\n  Ben. Soft! I will go along.\\n    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\\n  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:\\n    This is not Romeo, he\\'s some other where.\\nBen. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?\\n\\nRom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?\\n\\n  Ben. Groan? Why, no;\\n    But sadly tell me who.\\n  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.\\n    Ah, word ill urg\\'d to one that is so ill!\\n    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\\nBen. I aim\\'d so near when I suppos\\'d you lov\\'d.\\n\\nRom. A right good markman! And she\\'s fair I love.\\n\\nBen. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\\n\\n  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She\\'ll not be hit\\n    With Cupid\\'s arrow. She hath Dian\\'s wit,\\n    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm\\'d,\\n    From Love\\'s weak childish bow she lives unharm\\'d.\\n    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,\\n    Nor bide th\\' encounter of assailing eyes,\\n    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.\\n    O, she\\'s rich in beauty; only poor\\n    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\\nBen. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\\n\\n  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\\n    For beauty, starv\\'d with her severity,\\n    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.\\n    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\\n    To merit bliss by making me despair.\\n    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\\n    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.\\nBen. Be rul\\'d by me: forget to think of her.\\n\\nRom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!\\n\\n  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.\\n    Examine other beauties.\\n  Rom. \\'Tis the way\\n    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.\\n    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies\\' brows,\\n    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.\\n    He that is strucken blind cannot forget\\n    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\\n    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,\\n    What doth her beauty serve but as a note\\n    Where I may read who pass\\'d that passing fair?\\n    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.\\nBen. I\\'ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. Exeunt.\\n\\nScene II. A Street.\\nEnter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.\\n\\n  Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,\\n    In penalty alike; and \\'tis not hard, I think,\\n    For men so old as we to keep the peace.\\n  Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,\\n    And pity \\'tis you liv\\'d at odds so long.\\n    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?\\n  Cap. But saying o\\'er what I have said before:\\n    My child is yet a stranger in the world,\\n    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\\n    Let two more summers wither in their pride\\n    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.\\nPar. Younger than she are happy mothers made.\\n\\n  Cap. And too soon marr\\'d are those so early made.\\n    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;\\n    She is the hopeful lady of my earth.\\n    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;\\n    My will to her consent is but a part.\\n    An she agree, within her scope of choice\\n    Lies my consent and fair according voice.\\n    This night I hold an old accustom\\'d feast,\\n    Whereto I have invited many a guest,\\n    Such as I love; and you among the store,\\n    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.\\n    At my poor house look to behold this night\\n    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.\\n    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel\\n    When well apparell\\'d April on the heel\\n    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight\\n    Among fresh female buds shall you this night\\n    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,\\n    And like her most whose merit most shall be;\\n    Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,\\n    May stand in number, though in reck\\'ning none.\\n    Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,\\n    sirrah, trudge about\\n    Through fair Verona; find those persons out\\n    Whose names are written there, and to them say,\\n    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-\\n                                     Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].\\nServ. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!\\n\\nEnter Benvolio and Romeo.\\n\\n  Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another\\'s burning;\\n    One pain is lessoned by another\\'s anguish;\\n    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;\\n    One desperate grief cures with another\\'s languish.\\n    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,\\n    And the rank poison of the old will die.\\nRom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.\\n\\nBen. For what, I pray thee?\\n\\nRom. For your broken shin.\\n\\nBen. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?\\n\\n  Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;\\n    Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,\\n    Whipp\\'d and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.\\nServ. God gi\\' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?\\n\\nRom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.\\n\\nServ. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can you read anything you see?\\n\\nRom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.\\n\\nServ. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!\\n\\nRom. Stay, fellow; I can read. He reads.\\n\\n      \\'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;\\n      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;\\n      The lady widow of Vitruvio;\\n      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;\\n      Mercutio and his brother Valentine;\\n      Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;\\n      My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;\\n      Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;\\n      Lucio and the lively Helena.\\'\\n    [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they\\n    come?\\nServ. Up.\\n\\nRom. Whither?\\n\\nServ. To supper, to our house.\\n\\nRom. Whose house?\\n\\nServ. My master\\'s.\\n\\nRom. Indeed I should have ask\\'d you that before.\\n\\n  Serv. Now I\\'ll tell you without asking. My master is the great\\n    rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray\\n    come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry! Exit.\\n  Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet\\'s\\n    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov\\'st;\\n    With all the admired beauties of Verona.\\n    Go thither, and with unattainted eye\\n    Compare her face with some that I shall show,\\n    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.\\n  Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye\\n    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;\\n    And these, who, often drown\\'d, could never die,\\n    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!\\n    One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun\\n    Ne\\'er saw her match since first the world begun.\\n  Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,\\n    Herself pois\\'d with herself in either eye;\\n    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh\\'d\\n    Your lady\\'s love against some other maid\\n    That I will show you shining at this feast,\\n    And she shall scant show well that now seems best.\\n  Rom. I\\'ll go along, no such sight to be shown,\\n    But to rejoice in splendour of my own. [Exeunt.]\\nScene III. Capulet\\'s house.\\nEnter Capulet\\'s Wife, and Nurse.\\n\\nWife. Nurse, where\\'s my daughter? Call her forth to me.\\n\\n  Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,\\n    I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!\\n    God forbid! Where\\'s this girl? What, Juliet!\\nEnter Juliet.\\n\\nJul. How now? Who calls?\\n\\nNurse. Your mother.\\n\\n  Jul. Madam, I am here.\\n    What is your will?\\n  Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,\\n    We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;\\n    I have rememb\\'red me, thou\\'s hear our counsel.\\n    Thou knowest my daughter\\'s of a pretty age.\\nNurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\\n\\nWife. She\\'s not fourteen.\\n\\n  Nurse. I\\'ll lay fourteen of my teeth-\\n    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-\\n    She is not fourteen. How long is it now\\n    To Lammastide?\\nWife. A fortnight and odd days.\\n\\n  Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,\\n    Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\\n    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)\\n    Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\\n    She was too good for me. But, as I said,\\n    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\\n    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.\\n    \\'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\\n    And she was wean\\'d (I never shall forget it),\\n    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;\\n    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\\n    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.\\n    My lord and you were then at Mantua.\\n    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,\\n    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\\n    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\\n    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!\\n    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! \\'Twas no need, I trow,\\n    To bid me trudge.\\n    And since that time it is eleven years,\\n    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th\\' rood,\\n    She could have run and waddled all about;\\n    For even the day before, she broke her brow;\\n    And then my husband (God be with his soul!\\n    \\'A was a merry man) took up the child.\\n    \\'Yea,\\' quoth he, \\'dost thou fall upon thy face?\\n    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\\n    Wilt thou not, Jule?\\' and, by my holidam,\\n    The pretty wretch left crying, and said \\'Ay.\\'\\n    To see now how a jest shall come about!\\n    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,\\n    I never should forget it. \\'Wilt thou not, Jule?\\' quoth he,\\n    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said \\'Ay.\\'\\nWife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.\\n\\n  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh\\n    To think it should leave crying and say \\'Ay.\\'\\n    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow\\n    A bump as big as a young cock\\'rel\\'s stone;\\n    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.\\n    \\'Yea,\\' quoth my husband, \\'fall\\'st upon thy face?\\n    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\\n    Wilt thou not, Jule?\\' It stinted, and said \\'Ay.\\'\\nJul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.\\n\\n  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!\\n    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e\\'er I nurs\\'d.\\n    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.\\n  Wife. Marry, that \\'marry\\' is the very theme\\n    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\\n    How stands your disposition to be married?\\nJul. It is an honour that I dream not of.\\n\\n  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,\\n    I would say thou hadst suck\\'d wisdom from thy teat.\\n  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,\\n    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,\\n    Are made already mothers. By my count,\\n    I was your mother much upon these years\\n    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:\\n    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\\n  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man\\n    As all the world- why he\\'s a man of wax.\\nWife. Verona\\'s summer hath not such a flower.\\n\\nNurse. Nay, he\\'s a flower, in faith- a very flower.\\n\\n  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?\\n    This night you shall behold him at our feast.\\n    Read o\\'er the volume of young Paris\\' face,\\n    And find delight writ there with beauty\\'s pen;\\n    Examine every married lineament,\\n    And see how one another lends content;\\n    And what obscur\\'d in this fair volume lies\\n    Find written in the margent of his eyes,\\n    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,\\n    To beautify him only lacks a cover.\\n    The fish lives in the sea, and \\'tis much pride\\n    For fair without the fair within to hide.\\n    That book in many\\'s eyes doth share the glory,\\n    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\\n    So shall you share all that he doth possess,\\n    By having him making yourself no less.\\nNurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men\\n\\nWife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris\\' love?\\n\\n  Jul. I\\'ll look to like, if looking liking move;\\n    But no more deep will I endart mine eye\\n    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.\\nEnter Servingman.\\n\\nServ. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv\\'d up, you call\\'d, my young lady ask\\'d for, the nurse curs\\'d in the pantry, and everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you follow straight.\\n\\n  Wife. We follow thee. Exit [Servingman].\\n    Juliet, the County stays.\\n  Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\nScene IV. A street.\\nEnter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;\\nTorchbearers.\\n  Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\\n    Or shall we on without apology?\\n  Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.\\n    We\\'ll have no Cupid hoodwink\\'d with a scarf,\\n    Bearing a Tartar\\'s painted bow of lath,\\n    Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;\\n    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\\n    After the prompter, for our entrance;\\n    But, let them measure us by what they will,\\n    We\\'ll measure them a measure, and be gone.\\n  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.\\n    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.\\nMer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\\n\\n  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes\\n    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead\\n    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\\n  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid\\'s wings\\n    And soar with them above a common bound.\\n  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft\\n    To soar with his light feathers; and so bound\\n    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\\n    Under love\\'s heavy burthen do I sink.\\n  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-\\n    Too great oppression for a tender thing.\\n  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,\\n    Too rude, too boist\\'rous, and it pricks like thorn.\\n  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.\\n    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\\n    Give me a case to put my visage in.\\n    A visor for a visor! What care I\\n    What curious eye doth quote deformities?\\n    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.\\n  Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in\\n    But every man betake him to his legs.\\n  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart\\n    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\\n    For I am proverb\\'d with a grandsire phrase,\\n    I\\'ll be a candle-holder and look on;\\n    The game was ne\\'er so fair, and I am done.\\n  Mer. Tut! dun\\'s the mouse, the constable\\'s own word!\\n    If thou art Dun, we\\'ll draw thee from the mire\\n    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick\\'st\\n    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!\\nRom. Nay, that\\'s not so.\\n\\n  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay\\n    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.\\n    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits\\n    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.\\n  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;\\n    But \\'tis no wit to go.\\nMer. Why, may one ask?\\n\\nRom. I dreamt a dream to-night.\\n\\nMer. And so did I.\\n\\nRom. Well, what was yours?\\n\\nMer. That dreamers often lie.\\n\\nRom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\\n\\n  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\\n    She is the fairies\\' midwife, and she comes\\n    In shape no bigger than an agate stone\\n    On the forefinger of an alderman,\\n    Drawn with a team of little atomies\\n    Athwart men\\'s noses as they lie asleep;\\n    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners\\' legs,\\n    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\\n    Her traces, of the smallest spider\\'s web;\\n    Her collars, of the moonshine\\'s wat\\'ry beams;\\n    Her whip, of cricket\\'s bone; the lash, of film;\\n    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\\n    Not half so big as a round little worm\\n    Prick\\'d from the lazy finger of a maid;\\n    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,\\n    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\\n    Time out o\\' mind the fairies\\' coachmakers.\\n    And in this state she \\'gallops night by night\\n    Through lovers\\' brains, and then they dream of love;\\n    O\\'er courtiers\\' knees, that dream on cursies straight;\\n    O\\'er lawyers\\' fingers, who straight dream on fees;\\n    O\\'er ladies\\' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\\n    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\\n    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.\\n    Sometime she gallops o\\'er a courtier\\'s nose,\\n    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\\n    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig\\'s tail\\n    Tickling a parson\\'s nose as \\'a lies asleep,\\n    Then dreams he of another benefice.\\n    Sometimes she driveth o\\'er a soldier\\'s neck,\\n    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\\n    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\\n    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon\\n    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\\n    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two\\n    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab\\n    That plats the manes of horses in the night\\n    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,\\n    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes\\n    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\\n    That presses them and learns them first to bear,\\n    Making them women of good carriage.\\n    This is she-\\n  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!\\n    Thou talk\\'st of nothing.\\n  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;\\n    Which are the children of an idle brain,\\n    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;\\n    Which is as thin of substance as the air,\\n    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\\n    Even now the frozen bosom of the North\\n    And, being anger\\'d, puffs away from thence,\\n    Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.\\n  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.\\n    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.\\n  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives\\n    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,\\n    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date\\n    With this night\\'s revels and expire the term\\n    Of a despised life, clos\\'d in my breast,\\n    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.\\n    But he that hath the steerage of my course\\n    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!\\n  Ben. Strike, drum.\\n                           They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]\\nScene V. Capulet\\'s house.\\nServingmen come forth with napkins.\\n\\n  1. Serv. Where\\'s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?\\n    He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!\\n  2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men\\'s\\n    hands, and they unwash\\'d too, \\'tis a foul thing.\\n  1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,\\n    look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as\\n    thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and\\nNell.\\n    Anthony, and Potpan!\\n  2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.\\n  1. Serv. You are look\\'d for and call\\'d for, ask\\'d for and\\n    sought for, in the great chamber.\\n  3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!\\n    Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all. Exeunt.\\n    Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,\\n              Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests\\n               and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.\\n  Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes\\n    Unplagu\\'d with corns will have a bout with you.\\n    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all\\n    Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,\\n    She I\\'ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?\\n    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day\\n    That I have worn a visor and could tell\\n    A whispering tale in a fair lady\\'s ear,\\n    Such as would please. \\'Tis gone, \\'tis gone, \\'tis gone!\\n    You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.\\n    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.\\n                                    Music plays, and they dance.\\n    More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,\\n    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.\\n    Ah, sirrah, this unlook\\'d-for sport comes well.\\n    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,\\n    For you and I are past our dancing days.\\n    How long is\\'t now since last yourself and I\\n    Were in a mask?\\n  2. Cap. By\\'r Lady, thirty years.\\n  Cap. What, man? \\'Tis not so much, \\'tis not so much!\\n    \\'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,\\n    Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,\\n    Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask\\'d.\\n  2. Cap. \\'Tis more, \\'tis more! His son is elder, sir;\\n    His son is thirty.\\n  Cap. Will you tell me that?\\n    His son was but a ward two years ago.\\n  Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady\\'s that, which doth enrich the\\n    hand Of yonder knight?\\nServ. I know not, sir.\\n\\n  Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!\\n    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night\\n    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop\\'s ear-\\n    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!\\n    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows\\n    As yonder lady o\\'er her fellows shows.\\n    The measure done, I\\'ll watch her place of stand\\n    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.\\n    Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!\\n    For I ne\\'er saw true beauty till this night.\\n  Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.\\n    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave\\n    Come hither, cover\\'d with an antic face,\\n    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?\\n    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,\\n    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.\\nCap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?\\n\\n  Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;\\n    A villain, that is hither come in spite\\n    To scorn at our solemnity this night.\\nCap. Young Romeo is it?\\n\\nTyb. \\'Tis he, that villain Romeo.\\n\\n  Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.\\n    \\'A bears him like a portly gentleman,\\n    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him\\n    To be a virtuous and well-govern\\'d youth.\\n    I would not for the wealth of all this town\\n    Here in my house do him disparagement.\\n    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.\\n    It is my will; the which if thou respect,\\n    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,\\n    An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.\\n  Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.\\n    I\\'ll not endure him.\\n  Cap. He shall be endur\\'d.\\n    What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!\\n    Am I the master here, or you? Go to!\\n    You\\'ll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!\\n    You\\'ll make a mutiny among my guests!\\n    You will set cock-a-hoop! you\\'ll be the man!\\nTyb. Why, uncle, \\'tis a shame.\\n\\n  Cap. Go to, go to!\\n    You are a saucy boy. Is\\'t so, indeed?\\n    This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.\\n    You must contrary me! Marry, \\'tis time.-\\n    Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!\\n    Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!\\n    I\\'ll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!\\n  Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting\\n    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.\\n    I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,\\n    Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt\\'rest gall. Exit.\\n  Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand\\n    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:\\n    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand\\n    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.\\n  Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\\n    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;\\n    For saints have hands that pilgrims\\' hands do touch,\\n    And palm to palm is holy palmers\\' kiss.\\nRom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?\\n\\nJul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray\\'r.\\n\\n  Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!\\n    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.\\nJul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers\\' sake.\\n\\n  Rom. Then move not while my prayer\\'s effect I take.\\n    Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg\\'d. [Kisses her.]\\nJul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.\\n\\n  Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg\\'d!\\n    Give me my sin again. [Kisses her.]\\nJul. You kiss by th\\' book.\\n\\nNurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.\\n\\nRom.

Is she a Capulet?\\n    O dear account! my life is my foe\\'s debt.\\nBen. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.\\n\\nRom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.\\n\\n  Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;\\n    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.\\n    Is it e\\'en so? Why then, I thank you all.\\n    I thank you, honest gentlemen.

Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!\\n\\n  Mer. He is wise,\\n    And, on my life, hath stol\\'n him home to bed.\\n  Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.\\n    Call, good Mercutio.\\n  Mer. Nay, I\\'ll conjure too.\\n    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!\\n    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;\\n    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!\\n    Cry but \\'Ay me!\\' pronounce but \\'love\\' and \\'dove\\';\\n    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,\\n    One nickname for her purblind son and heir,\\n    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim\\n    When King Cophetua lov\\'d the beggar maid!\\n    He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;\\n    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.\\n    I conjure thee by Rosaline\\'s bright eyes.\\n    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,\\n    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,\\n    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,\\n    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!\\nBen. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.\\n\\n  Mer. This cannot anger him. \\'Twould anger him\\n    To raise a spirit in his mistress\\' circle\\n    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand\\n    Till she had laid it and conjur\\'d it down.\\n    That were some spite; my invocation\\n    Is fair and honest: in his mistress\\' name,\\n    I conjure only but to raise up him.\\n  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees\\n    To be consorted with the humorous night.\\n    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.\\n  Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.\\n    Now will he sit under a medlar tree\\n    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit\\n    As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.\\n    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were\\n    An open et cetera, thou a pop\\'rin pear!\\n    Romeo, good night.

Capulet\\'s orchard.\\nEnter Romeo.\\n\\nRom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.\\n\\nEnter Juliet above at a window.\\n\\n    But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?\\n    It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!\\n    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,\\n    Who is already sick and pale with grief\\n    That thou her maid art far more fair than she.\\n    Be not her maid, since she is envious.\\n    Her vestal livery is but sick and green,\\n    And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.\\n    It is my lady; O, it is my love!\\n    O that she knew she were!\\n    She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?\\n    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.\\n    I am too bold; \\'tis not to me she speaks.\\n    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\\n    Having some business, do entreat her eyes\\n    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.\\n    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?\\n    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars\\n    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\\n    Would through the airy region stream so bright\\n    That birds would sing and think it were not night.\\n    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!\\n    O that I were a glove upon that hand,\\n    That I might touch that cheek!\\nJul. Ay me!\\n\\n  Rom. She speaks.\\n    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art\\n    As glorious to this night, being o\\'er my head,\\n    As is a winged messenger of heaven\\n    Unto the white-upturned wond\\'ring eyes\\n    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him\\n    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds\\n    And sails upon the bosom of the air.\\n  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\\n    Deny thy father and refuse thy name!\\n    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\\n    And I\\'ll no longer be a Capulet.\\nRom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\\n\\n  Jul. \\'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\\n    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.\\n    What\\'s Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,\\n    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part\\n    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!\\n    What\\'s in a name? That which we call a rose\\n    By any other name would smell as sweet.\\n    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call\\'d,\\n    Retain that dear perfection which he owes\\n    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;\\n    And for that name, which is no part of thee,\\n    Take all myself.\\n  Rom. I take thee at thy word.\\n    Call me but love, and I\\'ll be new baptiz\\'d;\\n    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.\\n  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen\\'d in night,\\n    So stumblest on my counsel?\\n  Rom. By a name\\n    I know not how to tell thee who I am.\\n    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\\n    Because it is an enemy to thee.\\n    Had I it written, I would tear the word.\\n  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\\n    Of that tongue\\'s utterance, yet I know the sound.\\n    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\\nRom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.\\n\\n  Jul. How cam\\'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\\n    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\\n    And the place death, considering who thou art,\\n    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.\\n  Rom. With love\\'s light wings did I o\\'erperch these walls;\\n    For stony limits cannot hold love out,\\n    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.\\n    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.\\nJul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.\\n\\n  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye\\n    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,\\n    And I am proof against their enmity.\\nJul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.\\n\\n  Rom. I have night\\'s cloak to hide me from their sight;\\n    And but thou love me, let them find me here.\\n    My life were better ended by their hate\\n    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.\\nJul. By whose direction found\\'st thou out this place?\\n\\n  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.\\n    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\\n    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far\\n    As that vast shore wash\\'d with the farthest sea,\\n    I would adventure for such merchandise.\\n  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;\\n    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\\n    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.\\n    Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny\\n    What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!\\n    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say \\'Ay\\';\\n    And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear\\'st,\\n    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers\\' perjuries,\\n    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\\n    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\\n    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\\n    I\\'ll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,\\n    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.\\n    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\\n    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;\\n    But trust me, gentleman, I\\'ll prove more true\\n    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.\\n    I should have been more strange, I must confess,\\n    But that thou overheard\\'st, ere I was ware,\\n    My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,\\n    And not impute this yielding to light love,\\n    Which the dark night hath so discovered.\\n  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,\\n    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-\\n  Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th\\' inconstant moon,\\n    That monthly changes in her circled orb,\\n    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.\\nRom. What shall I swear by?\\n\\n  Jul.

Th\\' exchange of thy love\\'s faithful vow for mine.\\n\\n  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\\n    And yet I would it were to give again.\\nRom. Would\\'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\\n\\n  Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.\\n    And yet I wish but for the thing I have.\\n    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,\\n    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,\\n    The more I have, for both are infinite.\\n    I hear some noise within.

And I\\'ll still stay, to have thee still forget,\\n    Forgetting any other home but this.\\n  Jul. \\'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-\\n    And yet no farther than a wanton\\'s bird,\\n    That lets it hop a little from her hand,\\n    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\\n    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,\\n    So loving-jealous of his liberty.\\nRom.

That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.\\n\\nFriar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?\\n\\n  Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.\\n    I have forgot that name, and that name\\'s woe.\\nFriar. That\\'s my good son! But where hast thou been then?\\n\\n  Rom. I\\'ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.\\n    I have been feasting with mine enemy,\\n    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me\\n    That\\'s by me wounded.

Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift\\n    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.\\n  Rom. Then plainly know my heart\\'s dear love is set\\n    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;\\n    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,\\n    And all combin\\'d, save what thou must combine\\n    By holy marriage. When, and where, and how\\n    We met, we woo\\'d, and made exchange of vow,\\n    I\\'ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\\n    That thou consent to marry us to-day.\\n  Friar.

Young men\\'s love then lies\\n    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\\n    Jesu Maria!

And bad\\'st me bury love.\\n\\n  Friar. Not in a grave\\n    To lay one in, another out to have.\\n  Rom. I pray thee chide not.

A street.\\nEnter Benvolio and Mercutio.\\n\\n  Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?\\n    Came he not home to-night?\\nBen. Not to his father\\'s. I spoke with his man.\\n\\n  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,\\n    Torments him so that he will sure run mad.\\n  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,\\n    Hath sent a letter to his father\\'s house.\\nMer. A challenge, on my life.\\n\\nBen. Romeo will answer it.\\n\\nMer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.\\n\\nBen. Nay, he will answer the letter\\'s master, how he dares, being dared.\\n\\nMer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb\\'d with a white wench\\'s black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy\\'s butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?\\n\\nBen. Why, what is Tybalt?\\n\\nMer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he\\'s the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.\\n\\nBen. The what?\\n\\nMer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes- these new tuners of accent! \\'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good whore!\\' Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi\\'s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? O, their bones, their bones!\\n\\nEnter Romeo.\\n\\nBen. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!\\n\\nMer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy, Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There\\'s a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.\\n\\nRom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\\n\\nMer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?\\n\\n  Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a\\n    case as mine a man may strain courtesy.\\n  Mer. That\\'s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a\\n    man to bow in the hams.\\nRom. Meaning, to cursy.\\n\\nMer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.\\n\\nRom. A most courteous exposition.\\n\\nMer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\\n\\nRom. Pink for flower.\\n\\nMer. Right.\\n\\nRom. Why, then is my pump well-flower\\'d.\\n\\nMer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing, solely singular.\\n\\nRom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!\\n\\nMer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.\\n\\nRom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I\\'ll cry a match.\\n\\nMer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\\n\\nRom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose.\\n\\nMer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\\n\\nRom. Nay, good goose, bite not!\\n\\nMer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.\\n\\nRom. And is it not, then, well serv\\'d in to a sweet goose?\\n\\n  Mer. O, here\\'s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch\\n    narrow to an ell broad!\\n  Rom. I stretch it out for that word \\'broad,\\' which, added to\\n    the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.\\nMer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\\n\\nBen. Stop there, stop there!\\n\\nMer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\\n\\nBen. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\\n\\nMer. O, thou art deceiv\\'d! I would have made it short; for I was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer.\\n\\nRom. Here\\'s goodly gear!\\n\\nEnter Nurse and her Man [Peter].\\n\\nMer. A sail, a sail!\\n\\nBen. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.\\n\\nNurse. Peter!\\n\\nPeter. Anon.\\n\\nNurse.

Is it good-den?\\n\\nMer. \\'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon.\\n\\nNurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!\\n\\nRom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\\n\\n  Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. \\'For himself to mar,\\'\\n    quoth \\'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the\\n    young Romeo?\\n  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you\\n    have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest\\n    of that name, for fault of a worse.\\nNurse. You say well.\\n\\nMer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i\\' faith! wisely, wisely.\\n\\nNurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\\n\\nBen. She will endite him to some supper.\\n\\nMer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\\n\\nRom. What hast thou found?\\n\\n  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is\\n    something stale and hoar ere it be spent\\n                                     He walks by them and sings.\\n                   An old hare hoar,\\n                   And an old hare hoar,\\n                Is very good meat in Lent;\\n                   But a hare that is hoar\\n                   Is too much for a score\\n                When it hoars ere it be spent.\\nRomeo, will you come to your father\\'s?

I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant\\n    was this that was so full of his ropery?\\n  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and\\n    will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\\n  Nurse. An \\'a speak anything against me, I\\'ll take him down, an\\n\\'a\\n    were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,\\n    I\\'ll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his\\n    flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must\\n    stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!\\nPeter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.\\n\\nNurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you, my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into a fool\\'s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be off\\'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.\\n\\n  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\\n    thee-\\n  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,\\n    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.\\nRom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\\n\\n  Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I\\n    take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.\\n  Rom. Bid her devise\\n    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;\\n    And there she shall at Friar Laurence\\' cell\\n    Be shriv\\'d and married. Here is for thy pains.\\nNurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.\\n\\nRom. Go to! I say you shall.\\n\\nNurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\\n\\n  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.\\n    Within this hour my man shall be with thee\\n    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\\n    Which to the high topgallant of my joy\\n    Must be my convoy in the secret night.\\n    Farewell. Be trusty, and I\\'ll quit thy pains.\\n    Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.\\nNurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\\n\\nRom. What say\\'st thou, my dear nurse?\\n\\n  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne\\'er hear say,\\n    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?\\nRom. I warrant thee my man\\'s as true as steel.\\n\\nNurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! when \\'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man; but I\\'ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?\\n\\nRom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\\n\\nNurse. Ah, mocker! that\\'s the dog\\'s name. R is for the- No; I know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\\n\\nRom. Commend me to thy lady.\\n\\nNurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!\\n\\nPeter. Anon.\\n\\n  Nurse.

Good, good nurse, speak.\\n  Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?\\n    Do you not see that I am out of breath?\\n  Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath\\n    To say to me that thou art out of breath?\\n    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay\\n    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\\n    Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.\\n    Say either, and I\\'ll stay the circumstance.\\n    Let me be satisfied, is\\'t good or bad?\\n  Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to\\n    choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better\\n    than any man\\'s, yet his leg excels all men\\'s; and for a hand and a\\n    foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk\\'d on, yet\\n    they are past compare.

These violent delights have violent ends\\n    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,\\n    Which, as they kiss, consume.

Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\\n    Be heap\\'d like mine, and that thy skill be more\\n    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\\n    This neighbour air, and let rich music\\'s tongue\\n    Unfold the imagin\\'d happiness that both\\n    Receive in either by this dear encounter.\\n  Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,\\n    Brags of his substance, not of ornament.\\n    They are but beggars that can count their worth;\\n    But my true love is grown to such excess\\n    cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\\n  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;\\n    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\\n    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.\\n                                                       [Exeunt.]\\nACT III. Scene I. A public place.\\nEnter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.\\n\\n  Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let\\'s retire.\\n    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.\\n    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\\n    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\\n  Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters\\n    the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and\\n    says \\'God send me no need of thee!\\' and by the operation of the\\n    second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.\\nBen. Am I like such a fellow?\\n\\n  Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in\\n    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be\\n    moved.\\nBen. And what to?\\n\\nMer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell\\'d with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling!\\n\\nBen. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\\n\\nMer. The fee simple? O simple!\\n\\nEnter Tybalt and others.\\n\\nBen. By my head, here come the Capulets.\\n\\nMer. By my heel, I care not.\\n\\n  Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.\\n    Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.\\n  Mer. And but one word with one of us?\\n    Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.\\n  Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me\\n    occasion.\\nMer. Could you not take some occasion without giving\\n\\nTyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\\n\\n  Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make\\n    minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here\\'s my\\n    fiddlestick; here\\'s that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\\n  Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.\\n    Either withdraw unto some private place\\n    And reason coldly of your grievances,\\n    Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.\\n  Mer. Men\\'s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\\n    I will not budge for no man\\'s pleasure,\\nEnter Romeo.\\n\\nTyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.\\n\\n  Mer. But I\\'ll be hang\\'d, sir, if he wear your livery.\\n    Marry, go before to field, he\\'ll be your follower!\\n    Your worship in that sense may call him man.\\n  Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford\\n    No better term than this: thou art a villain.\\n  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\\n    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage\\n    To such a greeting. Villain am I none.\\n    Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.\\n  Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries\\n    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.\\n  Rom. I do protest I never injur\\'d thee,\\n    But love thee better than thou canst devise\\n    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;\\n    And so good Capulet, which name I tender\\n    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\\n  Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\\n    Alla stoccata carries it away. [Draws.]\\n    Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?\\nTyb. What wouldst thou have with me?\\n\\n  Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.\\nThat I\\n    mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,\\n    dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out\\n    of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your\\n    ears ere it be out.\\nTyb. I am for you. [Draws.]\\n\\nRom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\\n\\n  Mer. Come, sir, your passado!\\n                                                   [They fight.]\\n  Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\\n    Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!\\n    Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\\n    Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.\\n    Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!\\n         Tybalt under Romeo\\'s arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies\\n                                           [with his Followers].\\n  Mer. I am hurt.\\n    A plague o\\' both your houses! I am sped.\\n    Is he gone and hath nothing?\\nBen. What, art thou hurt?\\n\\n  Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, \\'tis enough.\\n    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.\\n                                                    [Exit Page.]\\nRom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.\\n\\n  Mer. No, \\'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;\\n    but \\'tis enough, \\'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you\\n    shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this\\n    world. A plague o\\' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a\\n    mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,\\na\\n    villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil\\n    came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.\\nRom. I thought all for the best.\\n\\n  Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,\\n    Or I shall faint. A plague o\\' both your houses!\\n    They have made worms\\' meat of me. I have it,\\n    And soundly too. Your houses!\\n                                 [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].\\n  Rom. This gentleman, the Prince\\'s near ally,\\n    My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt\\n    In my behalf- my reputation stain\\'d\\n    With Tybalt\\'s slander- Tybalt, that an hour\\n    Hath been my kinsman.

Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?\\n    Away to heaven respective lenity,\\n    And fire-ey\\'d fury be my conduct now!\\n    Now, Tybalt, take the \\'villain\\' back again\\n    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio\\'s soul\\n    Is but a little way above our heads,\\n    Staying for thine to keep him company.\\n    Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.\\n  Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,\\n    Shalt with him hence.\\n  Rom. This shall determine that.\\n                                       They fight. Tybalt falls.\\n  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!\\n    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.\\n    Stand not amaz\\'d. The Prince will doom thee death\\n    If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!\\nRom. O, I am fortune\\'s fool!\\n\\n  Ben. Why dost thou stay?\\n                                                     Exit Romeo.\\n                      Enter Citizens.\\n  Citizen.

Where are the vile beginners of this fray?\\n\\n  Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all\\n    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.\\n    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,\\n    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.\\n  Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother\\'s child!\\n    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill\\'d\\n    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,\\n    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.\\n    O cousin, cousin!\\nPrince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?\\n\\n  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo\\'s hand did stay.\\n    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\\n    How nice the quarrel was, and urg\\'d withal\\n    Your high displeasure. All this- uttered\\n    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow\\'d-\\n    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen\\n    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts\\n    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio\\'s breast;\\n    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\\n    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\\n    Cold death aside and with the other sends\\n    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\\n    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\\n    \\'Hold, friends! friends, part!\\' and swifter than his tongue,\\n    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,\\n    And \\'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\\n    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\\n    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;\\n    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,\\n    Who had but newly entertain\\'d revenge,\\n    And to\\'t they go like lightning; for, ere I\\n    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;\\n    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.\\n    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\\n  Cap.

He is a kinsman to the Montague;\\n    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.\\n    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,\\n    And all those twenty could but kill one life.\\n    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.\\n    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.\\n  Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.\\n    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\\n  Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio\\'s friend;\\n    His fault concludes but what the law should end,\\n    The life of Tybalt.\\n  Prince.

Can heaven be so envious?\\n\\n  Nurse. Romeo can,\\n    Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!\\n    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!\\n  Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?\\n    This torture should be roar\\'d in dismal hell.\\n    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but \\'I,\\'\\n    And that bare vowel \\'I\\' shall poison more\\n    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.\\n    I am not I, if there be such an \\'I\\';\\n    Or those eyes shut that make thee answer \\'I.\\'\\n    If he be slain, say \\'I\\'; or if not, \\'no.\\'\\n    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.\\n  Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,\\n    (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.\\n    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;\\n    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub\\'d in blood,\\n    All in gore-blood.

O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!\\n    To prison, eyes; ne\\'er look on liberty!\\n    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,\\n    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!\\n  Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!\\n    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman\\n    That ever I should live to see thee dead!\\n  Jul.

A gentler judgment vanish\\'d from his lips-\\n    Not body\\'s death, but body\\'s banishment.\\n  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say \\'death\\';\\n    For exile hath more terror in his look,\\n    Much more than death. Do not say \\'banishment.\\'\\n  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.\\n    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.\\n  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,\\n    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.\\n    Hence banished is banish\\'d from the world,\\n    And world\\'s exile is death. Then \\'banishment\\'\\n    Is death misterm\\'d. Calling death \\'banishment,\\'\\n    Thou cut\\'st my head off with a golden axe\\n    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\\n  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!\\n    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,\\n    Taking thy part, hath rush\\'d aside the law,\\n    And turn\\'d that black word death to banishment.\\n    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.\\n  Rom. \\'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,\\n    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog\\n    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,\\n    Live here in heaven and may look on her;\\n    But Romeo may not. More validity,\\n    More honourable state, more courtship lives\\n    In carrion flies than Romeo.

How hast thou the heart,\\n    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,\\n    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess\\'d,\\n    To mangle me with that word \\'banished\\'?\\nFriar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.\\n\\nRom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\\n\\n  Friar. I\\'ll give thee armour to keep off that word;\\n    Adversity\\'s sweet milk, philosophy,\\n    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.\\n  Rom. Yet \\'banished\\'? Hang up philosophy!\\n    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,\\n    Displant a town, reverse a prince\\'s doom,\\n    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.\\nFriar.

Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\\n    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\\n    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\\n    Doting like me, and like me banished,\\n    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\\n    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,\\n    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.\\n                                                 Knock [within].\\nFriar.

O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\\n    And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\\n    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,\\n    And then down falls again.\\n  Rom. As if that name,\\n    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,\\n    Did murther her; as that name\\'s cursed hand\\n    Murder\\'d her kinsman.

How now, wife?\\n    Have you delivered to her our decree?\\n  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.\\n    I would the fool were married to her grave!\\n  Cap.

Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt\\'s death,\\n    And therefore have I little talk\\'d of love;\\n    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\\n    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous\\n    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,\\n    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage\\n    To stop the inundation of her tears,\\n    Which, too much minded by herself alone,\\n    May be put from her by society.\\n    Now do you know the reason of this haste.\\n  Friar.

If I do so, it will be of more price,\\n    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.\\nPar. Poor soul, thy face is much abus\\'d with tears.\\n\\n  Jul.

Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;\\n    It strains me past the compass of my wits.\\n    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\\n    On Thursday next be married to this County.\\n  Jul.

Exit.\\nScene III. Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.\\nEnter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].\\n\\n  Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.\\n    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.\\n    Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,\\n    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.\\n    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread\\n    (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)\\n    But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,\\n    As signal that thou hear\\'st something approach.\\n    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.\\n  Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone\\n    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure. [Retires.]\\n  Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew\\n    (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)\\n    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;\\n    Or, wanting that, with tears distill\\'d by moans.\\n    The obsequies that I for thee will keep\\n    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.\\n                                                    Whistle Boy.\\n    The boy gives warning something doth approach.\\n    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night\\n    To cross my obsequies and true love\\'s rite?\\n    What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile. [Retires.]\\n       Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,\\n                    and a crow of iron.\\n  Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.\\n    Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning\\n    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.\\n    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,\\n    Whate\\'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof\\n    And do not interrupt me in my course.\\n    Why I descend into this bed of death\\n    Is partly to behold my lady\\'s face,\\n    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger\\n    A precious ring- a ring that I must use\\n    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.\\n    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry\\n    In what I farther shall intend to do,\\n    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint\\n    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\\n    The time and my intents are savage-wild,\\n    More fierce and more inexorable far\\n    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.\\nBal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\\n\\n  Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.\\n    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.\\n  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I\\'ll hide me hereabout.\\n    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt. [Retires.]\\n  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\\n    Gorg\\'d with the dearest morsel of the earth,\\n    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\\n    And in despite I\\'ll cram thee with more food.\\n                                           Romeo opens the tomb.\\n  Par. This is that banish\\'d haughty Montague\\n    That murd\\'red my love\\'s cousin- with which grief\\n    It is supposed the fair creature died-\\n    And here is come to do some villanous shame\\n    To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.\\n    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!\\n    Can vengeance be pursu\\'d further than death?\\n    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.\\n    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.\\n  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.\\n    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp\\'rate man.\\n    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;\\n    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\\n    But not another sin upon my head\\n    By urging me to fury. O, be gone!\\n    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,\\n    For I come hither arm\\'d against myself.\\n    Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say\\n    A madman\\'s mercy bid thee run away.\\n  Par. I do defy thy, conjuration\\n    And apprehend thee for a felon here.\\n  Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!\\n                                                     They fight.\\n  Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.\\n                                            [Exit. Paris falls.]\\n  Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,\\n    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. [Dies.]\\n  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.\\n    Mercutio\\'s kinsman, noble County Paris!\\n    What said my man when my betossed soul\\n    Did not attend him as we rode? I think\\n    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.\\n    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?\\n    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet\\n    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\\n    One writ with me in sour misfortune\\'s book!\\n    I\\'ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\\n    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught\\'red youth,\\n    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\\n    This vault a feasting presence full of light.\\n    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr\\'d.\\n                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]\\n    How oft when men are at the point of death\\n    Have they been merry! which their keepers call\\n    A lightning before death. O, how may I\\n    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!\\n    Death, that hath suck\\'d the honey of thy breath,\\n    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\\n    Thou art not conquer\\'d. Beauty\\'s ensign yet\\n    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\\n    And death\\'s pale flag is not advanced there.\\n    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\\n    O, what more favour can I do to thee\\n    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\\n    To sunder his that was thine enemy?\\n    Forgive me, cousin.\\' Ah, dear Juliet,\\n    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\\n    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,\\n    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps\\n    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?\\n    For fear of that I still will stay with thee\\n    And never from this palace of dim night\\n    Depart again. Here, here will I remain\\n    With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\\n    Will I set up my everlasting rest\\n    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\\n    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!\\n    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you\\n    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\\n    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!\\n    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!\\n    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on\\n    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!\\n    Here\\'s to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!\\n    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. Falls.\\nEnter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.\\n\\n  Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night\\n    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who\\'s there?\\nBal. Here\\'s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\\n\\n  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,\\n    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light\\n    To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,\\n    It burneth in the Capels\\' monument.\\n  Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there\\'s my master,\\n    One that you love.\\nFriar. Who is it?\\n\\nBal. Romeo.\\n\\nFriar. How long hath he been there?\\n\\nBal. Full half an hour.\\n\\nFriar. Go with me to the vault.\\n\\n  Bal. I dare not, sir.\\n    My master knows not but I am gone hence,\\n    And fearfully did menace me with death\\n    If I did stay to look on his intents.\\n  Friar. Stay then; I\\'ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\\n    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.\\n  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,\\n    I dreamt my master and another fought,\\n    And that my master slew him.\\n  Friar. Romeo!\\n    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains\\n    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?\\n    What mean these masterless and gory swords\\n    To lie discolour\\'d by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]\\n    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?\\n    And steep\\'d in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour\\n    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.\\n                                                   Juliet rises.\\n  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?\\n    I do remember well where I should be,\\n    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?\\n  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest\\n    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.\\n    A greater power than we can contradict\\n    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\\n    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;\\n    And Paris too. Come, I\\'ll dispose of thee\\n    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.\\n    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.\\n    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.\\n  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.\\n                                                   Exit [Friar].\\n    What\\'s here? A cup, clos\\'d in my true love\\'s hand?\\n    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.\\n    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop\\n    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.\\n    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them\\n    To make me die with a restorative. [Kisses him.]\\n    Thy lips are warm!\\n  Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?\\n    Yea, noise? Then I\\'ll be brief. O happy dagger!\\n                                      [Snatches Romeo\\'s dagger.]\\n    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.\\n                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo\\'s body].\\nEnter [Paris\\'s] Boy and Watch.\\n\\nBoy.

Watch. Here\\'s Romeo\\'s man. We found him in the churchyard.\\n\\nChief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.\\n\\nEnter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.\\n\\n  3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.\\n    We took this mattock and this spade from him\\n    As he was coming from this churchyard side.\\nChief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.\\n\\nEnter the Prince [and Attendants].\\n\\n  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,\\n    That calls our person from our morning rest?\\nEnter Capulet and his Wife [with others].\\n\\nCap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?\\n\\n  Wife. The people in the street cry \\'Romeo,\\'\\n    Some \\'Juliet,\\' and some \\'Paris\\'; and all run,\\n    With open outcry, toward our monument.\\nPrince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?\\n\\n  Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;\\n    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,\\n    Warm and new kill\\'d.\\nPrince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\\n\\n  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter\\'d Romeo\\'s man,\\n    With instruments upon them fit to open\\n    These dead men\\'s tombs.\\n  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\\n    This dagger hath mista\\'en, for, lo, his house\\n    Is empty on the back of Montague,\\n    And it missheathed in my daughter\\'s bosom!\\n  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell\\n    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.\\nEnter Montague [and others].\\n\\n  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up\\n    To see thy son and heir more early down.\\n  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!\\n    Grief of my son\\'s exile hath stopp\\'d her breath.\\n    What further woe conspires against mine age?\\nPrince. Look, and thou shalt see.\\n\\n  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,\\n    To press before thy father to a grave?\\n  Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\\n    Till we can clear these ambiguities\\n    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;\\n    And then will I be general of your woes\\n    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\\n    And let mischance be slave to patience.\\n    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.\\n  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,\\n    Yet most suspected, as the time and place\\n    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;\\n    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge\\n    Myself condemned and myself excus\\'d.\\nPrince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.\\n\\n  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath\\n    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.\\n    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;\\n    And she, there dead, that Romeo\\'s faithful wife.\\n    I married them; and their stol\\'n marriage day\\n    Was Tybalt\\'s doomsday, whose untimely death\\n    Banish\\'d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\\n    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin\\'d.\\n    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,\\n    Betroth\\'d and would have married her perforce\\n    To County Paris. Then comes she to me\\n    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean\\n    To rid her from this second marriage,\\n    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.\\n    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)\\n    A sleeping potion; which so took effect\\n    As I intended, for it wrought on her\\n    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\\n    That he should hither come as this dire night\\n    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,\\n    Being the time the potion\\'s force should cease.\\n    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,\\n    Was stay\\'d by accident, and yesternight\\n    Return\\'d my letter back. Then all alone\\n    At the prefixed hour of her waking\\n    Came I to take her from her kindred\\'s vault;\\n    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell\\n    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.\\n    But when I came, some minute ere the time\\n    Of her awaking, here untimely lay\\n    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\\n    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth\\n    And bear this work of heaven with patience;\\n    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,\\n    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,\\n    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.\\n    All this I know, and to the marriage\\n    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this\\n    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life\\n    Be sacrific\\'d, some hour before his time,\\n    Unto the rigour of severest law.\\n  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.\\n    Where\\'s Romeo\\'s man? What can he say in this?\\n  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet\\'s death;\\n    And then in post he came from Mantua\\n    To this same place, to this same monument.\\n    This letter he early bid me give his father,\\n    And threat\\'ned me with death, going in the vault,\\n    If I departed not and left him there.\\n  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.\\n    Where is the County\\'s page that rais\\'d the watch?\\n    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?\\n  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady\\'s grave;\\n    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\\n    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;\\n    And by-and-by my master drew on him;\\n    And then I ran away to call the watch.\\n  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar\\'s words,\\n    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;\\n    And here he writes that he did buy a poison\\n    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal\\n    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\\n    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,\\n    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\\n    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\\n    And I, for winking at you, discords too,\\n    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish\\'d.\\n  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.\\n    This is my daughter\\'s jointure, for no more\\n    Can I demand.\\n  Mon. But I can give thee more;\\n    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,\\n    That whiles Verona by that name is known,\\n    There shall no figure at such rate be set\\n    As that of true and faithful Juliet.\\n  Cap. As rich shall Romeo\\'s by his lady\\'s lie-\\n    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!\\n  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.\\n    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.\\n    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;\\n    Some shall be pardon\\'d, and some punished;\\n    For never was a story of more woe\\n    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\\n                                                   Exeunt omnes.\\nTHE END'"

In the instant came\\n    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;\\n    Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,\\n    He swung about his head and cut the winds,\\n    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.\\n    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,\\n    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,\\n    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.\\n  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?\\n    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.\\n  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun\\n    Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,\\n    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;\\n    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore\\n    That westward rooteth from the city's side,\\n    So early walking did I see your son.\\n    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me\\n    And stole into the covert of the wood.\\n    I- measuring his affections by my own,\\n    Which then most sought where most might not be found,\\n    Being one too many by my weary self-\\n    Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,\\n    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.\\n  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,\\n    With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,\\n    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\\n    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun\\n    Should in the furthest East bean to draw\\n    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,\\n    Away from light steals home my heavy son\\n    And private in his chamber pens himself,\\n    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight\\n    And makes himself an artificial night.\\n    Black and portentous must this humour prove\\n    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.\\nBen. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?\\n\\nMon. I neither know it nor can learn of him\\n\\nBen. Have you importun'd him by any means?\\n\\n  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;\\n    But he, his own affections' counsellor,\\n    Is to himself- I will not say how true-\\n    But to himself so secret and so close,\\n    So far from sounding and discovery,\\n    As is the bud bit with an envious worm\\n    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air\\n    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.\\n    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\\n    We would as willingly give cure as know.\\nEnter Romeo.\\n\\n  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,\\n    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.\\n  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay\\n    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,\\n                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].\\nBen. Good morrow, cousin.\\n\\nRom. Is the day so young?\\n\\nBen. But new struck nine.\\n\\n  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.\\n    Was that my father that went hence so fast?\\nBen. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?\\n\\nRom. Not having that which having makes them short.\\n\\nBen. In love?\\n\\nRom. Out-\\n\\nBen. Of love?\\n\\nRom. Out of her favour where I am in love.\\n\\n  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,\\n    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\\n  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,\\n    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!\\n    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\\n    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\\n    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.\\n    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\\n    O anything, of nothing first create!\\n    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!\\n    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\\n    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\\n    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is\\n    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.\\n    Dost thou not laugh?\\nBen. No, coz, I rather weep.\\n\\nRom. Good heart, at what?\\n\\nBen. At thy good heart's oppression.\\n\\n  Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.\\n    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\\n    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest\\n    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\\n    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.\\n    Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;\\n    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;\\n    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.\\n    What is it else? A madness most discreet,\\n    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\\n    Farewell, my coz.\\n  Ben. Soft! I will go along.\\n    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\\n  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:\\n    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.\\nBen. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?\\n\\nRom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?\\n\\n  Ben. Groan? Why, no;\\n    But sadly tell me who.\\n  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.\\n    Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!\\n    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\\nBen. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.\\n\\nRom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.\\n\\nBen. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\\n\\n  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit\\n    With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,\\n    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,\\n    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.\\n    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,\\n    Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,\\n    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.\\n    O, she's rich in beauty; only poor\\n    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\\nBen. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\\n\\n  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\\n    For beauty, starv'd with her severity,\\n    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.\\n    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\\n    To merit bliss by making me despair.\\n    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\\n    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.\\nBen. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.\\n\\nRom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!\\n\\n  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.\\n    Examine other beauties.\\n  Rom. 'Tis the way\\n    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.\\n    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,\\n    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.\\n    He that is strucken blind cannot forget\\n    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\\n    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,\\n    What doth her beauty serve but as a note\\n    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?\\n    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.\\nBen. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. Exeunt.\\n\\n\""

No, for then we should be colliers.\\n\\nSamp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.\\n\\nGreg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.\\n\\nSamp. I strike quickly, being moved.\\n\\nGreg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.\\n\\nSamp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.\\n\\n  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.\\n    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.\\n  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take\\n    the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.\\n  Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the\\n    wall.\\n  Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,\\n    are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men\\n    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.\\nGreg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\\n\\nSamp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off their heads.\\n\\nGreg. The heads of the maids?\\n\\n  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.\\n    Take it in what sense thou wilt.\\nGreg. They must take it in sense that feel it.\\n\\n  Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I\\n    am a pretty piece of flesh.\\n  Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst\\n    been poor-John. Draw thy tool!

How? turn thy back and run?\\n\\nSamp. Fear me not.\\n\\nGreg. No, marry. I fear thee!\\n\\nSamp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\\n\\nGreg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.\\n\\nSamp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is disgrace to them, if they bear it.\\n\\nAbr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\n\\nSamp. I do bite my thumb, sir.\\n\\nAbr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\n\\nSamp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?\\n\\nGreg. [aside to Sampson] No.\\n\\nSamp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.\\n\\nGreg. Do you quarrel, sir?\\n\\nAbr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.\\n\\nSamp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as you.\\n\\nAbr. No better.\\n\\nSamp. Well, sir.\\n\\nEnter Benvolio.\\n\\nGreg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.'

Nurse, come back again;\\n    I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.\\n    Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.\\nNurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\\n\\nWife. She's not fourteen.\\n\\n  Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-\\n    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-\\n    She is not fourteen. How long is it now\\n    To Lammastide?\\nWife. A fortnight and odd days.\\n\\n  Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,\\n    Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\\n    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)\\n    Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\\n    She was too good for me. But, as I said,\\n    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\\n    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.\\n    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\\n    And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),\\n    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;\\n    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\\n    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.\\n    My lord and you were then at Mantua.\\n    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,\\n    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\\n    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\\n    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!\\n    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,\\n    To bid me trudge.\\n    And since that time it is eleven years,\\n    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,\\n    She could have run and waddled all about;\\n    For even the day before, she broke her brow;\\n    And then my husband (God be with his soul!\\n    'A was a merry man) took up the child.\\n    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?\\n    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\\n    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,\\n    The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'\\n    To see now how a jest shall come about!\\n    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,\\n    I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,\\n    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'\\nWife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.\\n\\n  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh\\n    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'\\n    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow\\n    A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;\\n    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.\\n    'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?\\n    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\\n    Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'\\nJul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.\\n\\n  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!\\n    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.\\n    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.\\n  Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme\\n    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\\n    How stands your disposition to be married?\\nJul. It is an honour that I dream not of.\\n\\n  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,\\n    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.\\n  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,\\n    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,\\n    Are made already mothers. By my count,\\n    I was your mother much upon these years\\n    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:\\n    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\\n  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man\\n    As all the world- why he's a man of wax.\\nWife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.\\n\\nNurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.\\n\\n  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?\\n    This night you shall behold him at our feast.\\n    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,\\n    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;\\n    Examine every married lineament,\\n    And see how one another lends content;\\n    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies\\n    Find written in the margent of his eyes,\\n    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,\\n    To beautify him only lacks a cover.\\n    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride\\n    For fair without the fair within to hide.\\n    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,\\n    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\\n    So shall you share all that he doth possess,\\n    By having him making yourself no less.\\nNurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men\\n\\nWife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?\\n\\n  Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;\\n    But no more deep will I endart mine eye\\n    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.\\nEnter Servingman.\\n\\nServ. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd, my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you follow straight.\\n\\n  Wife. We follow thee. Exit [Servingman].\\n    Juliet, the County stays.\\n  Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\nScene IV. A street.\\nEnter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;\\nTorchbearers.\\n  Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\\n    Or shall we on without apology?\\n  Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.\\n    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,\\n    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,\\n    Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;\\n    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\\n    After the prompter, for our entrance;\\n    But, let them measure us by what they will,\\n    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.\\n  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.\\n    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.\\nMer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\\n\\n  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes\\n    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead\\n    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\\n  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings\\n    And soar with them above a common bound.\\n  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft\\n    To soar with his light feathers; and so bound\\n    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\\n    Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.\\n  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-\\n    Too great oppression for a tender thing.\\n  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,\\n    Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.\\n  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.\\n    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\\n    Give me a case to put my visage in.\\n    A visor for a visor! What care I\\n    What curious eye doth quote deformities?\\n    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.\\n  Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in\\n    But every man betake him to his legs.\\n  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart\\n    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\\n    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,\\n    I'll be a candle-holder and look on;\\n    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.\\n  Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!\\n    If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire\\n    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st\\n    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!\\nRom. Nay, that's not so.\\n\\n  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay\\n    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.\\n    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits\\n    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.\\n  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;\\n    But 'tis no wit to go.\\nMer. Why, may one ask?\\n\\nRom. I dreamt a dream to-night.\\n\\nMer. And so did I.\\n\\nRom. Well, what was yours?\\n\\nMer. That dreamers often lie.\\n\\nRom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\\n\\n  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\\n    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes\\n    In shape no bigger than an agate stone\\n    On the forefinger of an alderman,\\n    Drawn with a team of little atomies\\n    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;\\n    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,\\n    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\\n    Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;\\n    Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;\\n    Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;\\n    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\\n    Not half so big as a round little worm\\n    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;\\n    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,\\n    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\\n    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\\n    And in this state she 'gallops night by night\\n    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;\\n    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;\\n    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;\\n    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\\n    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\\n    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.\\n    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,\\n    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\\n    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail\\n    Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,\\n    Then dreams he of another benefice.\\n    Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,\\n    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\\n    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\\n    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon\\n    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\\n    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two\\n    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab\\n    That plats the manes of horses in the night\\n    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,\\n    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes\\n    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\\n    That presses them and learns them first to bear,\\n    Making them women of good carriage.\\n    This is she-\\n  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!\\n    Thou talk'st of nothing.\\n  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;\\n    Which are the children of an idle brain,\\n    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;\\n    Which is as thin of substance as the air,\\n    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\\n    Even now the frozen bosom of the North\\n    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,\\n    Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.\\n  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.\\n    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.\\n  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives\\n    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,\\n    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date\\n    With this night's revels and expire the term\\n    Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,\\n    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.\\n    But he that hath the steerage of my course\\n    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!\\n  Ben. Strike, drum.\\n                           They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]\\nScene V. Capulet's house.\\nServingmen come forth with napkins.\\n\\n  1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?\\n    He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!\\n  2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's\\n    hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.\\n  1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,\\n    look to the plate.

She that makes dainty,\\n    She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?\\n    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day\\n    That I have worn a visor and could tell\\n    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,\\n    Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!\\n    You are welcome, gentlemen!

'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;\\n    His son is thirty.\\n  Cap. Will you tell me that?\\n    His son was but a ward two years ago.\\n  Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the\\n    hand Of yonder knight?\\nServ. I know not, sir.\\n\\n  Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!\\n    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night\\n    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-\\n    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!\\n    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows\\n    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.\\n    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand\\n    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.\\n    Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!\\n    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.\\n  Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.\\n    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave\\n    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,\\n    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?\\n    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,\\n    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.\\nCap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?\\n\\n  Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;\\n    A villain, that is hither come in spite\\n    To scorn at our solemnity this night.\\nCap. Young Romeo is it?\\n\\nTyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.\\n\\n  Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.\\n    'A bears him like a portly gentleman,\\n    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him\\n    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.\\n    I would not for the wealth of all this town\\n    Here in my house do him disparagement.\\n    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.\\n    It is my will; the which if thou respect,\\n    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,\\n    An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.\\n  Tyb.

Go to!\\n    You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!\\n    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!\\n    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!\\nTyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.\\n\\n  Cap. Go to, go to!\\n    You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?\\n    This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.\\n    You must contrary me!

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\\n    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;\\n    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,\\n    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.\\nRom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?\\n\\nJul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.\\n\\n  Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!\\n    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.\\nJul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.\\n\\n  Rom.

    "#### The graph contains information on characters and their connections. Each node represents a character in the play and the size of the node represents how many scenes that character is in. The edges represent the connections between characters, so characters that are connected by an edge occur and speak in a scene together. The width of each edge is the weight of the connection between those two characters relative to the max value of all the weights. So, the thicker the edge is, the more scenes these characters occur in together and the more interaction between them. "
