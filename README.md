Hi! My name is Karinn and I'm a senior at UCLA studying Business Economics with a minor in Digital Humanities. I'm originally from Southern California and will be moving to New York after graduation to work in finance. Digital Humanities 140, Coding for Humanities, focuses on learning how to use Python to write code and tell stories. More specifically, this class focuses on how Python can be used in the humanities. Through this class I hope to gain experience in coding and data science as well as become proficient in Python. Through a final project, I hope to use Python to analyze and visualize data in order to draw meaningful conclusions. I'm interested in music and fashion, and am considering pursuing a project in one of these industries such as analyzing e-commerce trends or creating personalized playlists/song recommendations from data such as done by Spotify.
